 * Release-time schema entrypoint.
 *
 * Every deploy runs this once, and request functions never touch schema. That
 * ordering is not an optimization: on serverless, "migrate on first use" means
 * migrate on EVERY cold start, and a production incident traced a multi-hour
 * outage to schema introspection running 4-6 times concurrently on the request
 * path.
 *
 * `withMigrationRuntime()` is load-bearing. The Netlify BUILD environment sets
 * NETLIFY=true, so this script looks like a serverless request to the guard in
 * `runMigrations` — it is allowed to migrate only because it claims duty here.
 * A release entrypoint that forgets the wrapper silently does nothing.
 *
 * This entrypoint owns framework tables only. App tables in a managed Drizzle
 * project are generated from `drizzle/schema.ts` and applied by `db:migrate`.
